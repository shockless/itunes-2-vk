# Yandex Music Importer
Since Yandex forbade uploading songs to the library with a text field, I suggest using the yandex_music library and the tunemymusic service to quickly transfer the library between apple music and yandex.


## Run downloader
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python importer.py
```


TODO:
1. Fix track insertion into playlists
2. Enable logging in the account with API
3. Enable logging in Apple Music account to transfer seemlessly
